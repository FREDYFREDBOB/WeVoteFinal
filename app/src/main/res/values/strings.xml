x To increase student feedback in order to provide a
service more tailored to what students want, through
drop-in sessions, suggestion boxes, email surveys and
face-to-face contact.


x To increase Postgraduate, International, Mature and
LGBT student participation and awareness. To do so I will
improve communications between those student bodies

    <string name="TRUSU">The Thompson Rivers University Students’ Union is a democratic, membership-based organisation. This is the greatest factor in determining the structure of the organisation and how decisions are made. The membership as a whole is the highest decision-making body, and all members have the ability to exercise their decision-making rights with an equal vote at the Union’s Annual General Meeting. Every year, the members also exercise their right to vote in the election of a Board of Directors.
